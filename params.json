{"name":"ZF Template","body":"### Template for Zend Framework based projects\r\n\r\nIt's really simple template, but it speeds up ZF based projects bootstrap :). Some nice features:\r\n\r\n* it is integrated with DoctrineORM framework (thanks to Bisna library)\r\n* layouts are based on Twitter Bootstrap\r\n* there are two modules - one for users, other for administrators\r\n* project configuration is optimised for use in project that many developers are working on\r\n* PHPUnit tests and Doctrine CLI are working out of the box\r\n\r\n### Quick start\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\nYou have to have following libraries in your include path:\r\n\r\n* Zend Framework (preferably version 1.11.11, I didn't test it on older ones, but should work :))\r\n* DoctrineORM (version 2.2.1)\r\n* PHP 5.3.0+ (as Doctrine uses PHP 5.3 stuff)\r\n* PHPUnit 3.6.10 (optional, but recomended)\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\n* clone this github repo into your computer (you can also download zip or tar.gz package with it)\r\n* set up your web server, for apache you can use configuration like that\r\n\r\n```\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n   DocumentRoot \"/path/project-folder/public\"\r\n   ServerName name.local\r\n\r\n   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development\r\n\r\n   <Directory \"/path/project-folder/public\">\r\n       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\r\n       AllowOverride All\r\n       Order allow,deny\r\n       Allow from all\r\n   </Directory>\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\n* add row in your /etc/hosts file, so you can access your project at URL like http://name.local (if you have some fancy configuration with DNS, you probably don't need it, but if you have such fancy configuration you probably won't read this ;)).\r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1 name.local\r\n```\r\n\r\n* restart your web server, point your browser to http://name.local and enjoy. You can access admin zone at http://name.local/backend\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n* Bisna https://github.com/guilhermeblanco/ZendFramework1-Doctrine2\r\n* Zend Framework http://framework.zend.com/\r\n* Doctrine http://www.doctrine-project.org/\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\r\n\r\nThanks to all these projects :).","tagline":"Template for creating new ZF project (includes ZF 1.11.11, DoctrineORM 2.2.1 and Twitter Bootstrap)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
